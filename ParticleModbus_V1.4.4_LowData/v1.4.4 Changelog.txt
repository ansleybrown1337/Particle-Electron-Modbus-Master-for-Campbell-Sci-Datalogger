Particle Photon/Electron Modbus Master
Created by A.J. Brown and Sam Gallo, 06/06/18 version 1.4.4
This project was designed to allow a particle photon or electron to act as a
modbus master for a Campbell Scientific datalogger (as Slave) set up with 14
registers that hold water content reflectometer data from 3 CS655 sensors.

Updated in 1.4.4
-Removed "calibrated" because it is an unnecessary variable that should be taken care of in post processing
-Added "ReadingTime" variable to make it user friendly when deciding time between readings
-Changed sleep function to be a function of the reading time.
 The device will always wake up 5 min before the next reading.

Future Goals:
-add a way to automatically read for x number of sensors based on input value
-Find other ways to reduce amount of data sent
-Take 15 minute readings, and average them into hourly readings to send
	-could come out of other sleep modes that retain RAM
