****REGARDING RED LED ON ELECTRON BOARD (NOT PRIMARY LED)****
The battery should charge when you have the USB plugged in to the Electron.

There is a red LED that lights up when the battery is charging above 50mA and the LED is off when the charging current is below 50mA.

The red LED will flash rapidly if you connect the USB port with no battery connected.
